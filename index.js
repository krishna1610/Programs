/* 1) Write a function isMultiple that accepts two non-negative number parameters a and b, 
and returns true if a is a multiple of b, and false otherwise. For example, the call of 
isMultiple(15, 5) would return true because 15 = 5 * 3. You may assume that a and b are 
non-negative integers and that b is not 0. */
